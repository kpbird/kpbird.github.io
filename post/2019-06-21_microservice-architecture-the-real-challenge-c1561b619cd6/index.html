<h2 id="microservice-architecture-the-real-challenge">Microservice Architecture: The Real Challenge</h2>
<p><em>Microservice</em> is a buzzword among the developer community. In this
article, we will explore the most important points about Microservice
architecture that are seldom addressed elsewhere. We will try to cover
all the practical problems of moving to microservice architecture.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some advantages of microservice architecture. Following
are three major advantage for which you may consider moving to
microservice architecture.</p>
<ol>
<li>Engineering flexibility: Each service team can choose a different
programming language or framework. (provided interoperability is
taken care of between the languages and protocols).</li>
<li>Independent development: Services can be developed, deployed and
maintained independently (It&rsquo;s not 100% true, we will see why
later)</li>
<li>Technology flexibility: Easy to introduce new technology i.e.
Blockchain, AI/ML etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will find many articles on the Internet discussing the advantages of
microservices in detail but my intention is to highlight some practical
problems.</p>
<p>If you are doing microservice for the first time then It will be
Pandora&rsquo;s box. You will find many surprises which you never read on any
article advocating microservices.</p>
<p>So, Let&rsquo;s jump to the practical world of microservice architecture. We
will focus on the following areas of microservice architecture.</p>
<ol>
<li>Communication between services</li>
<li>Service Management</li>
<li>Observability</li>
<li>Developer&rsquo;s Life</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-communication-between-services">1. Communication between services</h2>
<p>The complexity of communication between services (aka routing) increases
exponentially with the number of services. It&rsquo;s simple and manageable if
the project has 10&ndash;12 services but it becomes more and more complex if
the project has 20+ services. It&rsquo;s difficult to remember and understand
which service communicate with whom. Imagine a star network with 100s of
nodes.</p>
<p>Following diagram shows a simple and complex example.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://microservices.io">https://microservices.io</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/339817/should-services-talk-directly-to-each-other-in-a-microservice-architecture">https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/339817/should-services-talk-directly-to-each-other-in-a-microservice-architecture</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any consideration for choosing microservice architecture must answer the
following questions first.</p>
<ol>
<li>How does service A makes a request to service B? The answer can be
dependent upon a number of services you have in the product. It can
be simple HTTP, RPC or Websocket which send a request and gets a
response back. After deciding communication protocol next thing
would be&hellip;</li>
<li>Where are (healthy) instances running?</li>
<li>How does service A find Healthy instances of a particular
service?</li>
<li>How to define &ldquo;health&rdquo; of a service?</li>
</ol>
<p>You need tools which helps you to solve the above issues. A tool that
continuously monitors all instances of all services and keeps track of
their health status. Basically, you need a service registry. [Consul] by
HashiCorp is the most common service registry. Consul will help to
maintain a list of instances, which instances are healthy and which are
not.</p>
<p>You can also look for [ZooKeeper by Apache] or you can use container
orchestrator engines like Kuberneters. Container orchestrator will take
care of all.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to depend upon 3rd party tools and like adventure then
you can use DNS registry. If you decided to use DNS as a service
registry then remember that DNS doesn&rsquo;t return port number by default.
Of course, you can do SRV or DNS lookup which returns the port number,
but it&rsquo;s not normal practice and DNS is not fast to respond to change
and It also does not give health status.</p>
<p>The really simple option is to create small EC2 instance per service and
scale manually as per your need. It will work if you have a limited
number of services but it will not give you agility and speed of service
registry. Scaling will be slow because you need to create EC2 instance
each time and creating instance takes time.</p>
<p>If you are a Redis fan and you already have Redis in your current
infrastructure, you can explore [Hydra]. Hydra is a node package which
helps for routing, discovery, registry etc. which facilitates building
distributed applications such as Microservices. Hydra does this by
leveraging the power of Redis.</p>
<p>We solved (sort of) the first problem of microservice, which is to
identify healthy instances of service.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s move on to the second challenge, which is load balancing.</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to decide which instance of service you need to send a
request to.</li>
<li>What should be the timeout?</li>
<li>What if the request fails?</li>
<li>If a request fails then you need to decide retry policy.</li>
<li>How many time do you need to retry?</li>
</ol>
<p>In Microservice, defensive coding is important. Defensive coding means
taking extra care of error handling. Every service communicates with
others via Network and many things can go wrong on the network. It is
possible that service is slow in response or service might be
overloaded, In this situation, you need to think how best you can handle
the response.</p>
<p>Rate limiting is a common technique that you need to use. A service
receives traffic from a bunch of other services. What to do when a
service gets overloaded with request? What you can do to prevent
overloading in the first place? The rate limit is an option to preserve
overloading service. Consul has a feature to configure the rate limit.</p>
<p>Now, There are main two popular ways to handle this complex business
logic regarding service to service communication, i.e. rate limit, load
balancing, service discovery, health check etc.</p>
<ol>
<li>Client-Side management</li>
<li>Service Mesh</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Client-Side management</strong> is simple. For example, When service A wants
to call Service B, Service A acts as a client of Service B and Service B
acts as a server. Service A has all client-side logic to handle
everything Service B is offering it. Service A can have all logic
related to timeouts, retries, which instance to call, etc. This approach
offers the following benefits and challenges.</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy to understand, potentially easier to debug.</li>
<li>Managing client libraries can be difficult especially when services
are developed in different programming languages.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a tight coupling between services. Eg. Any change in Service
A&rsquo;s API/RPC needs to be implemented in all services which have a
client of Service A. This will be a lot of effort if you have 100s
of services because client-side logic is built into all service. You
need to update all instances which have Service A&rsquo;s client even
though Server itself doesn&rsquo;t have undergone any changes. Compare
this with a monolithic architecture. You deploy an update once, and
that&rsquo;s it.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In a Service Mesh approach</strong>, the logic related to client-side is
extracted in to a proxy program called &ldquo;Sidecar&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mesh&rdquo;. Service Mesh
runs alongside every service. In this approach, Mesh instance
communicate with each other, services are not directly communicating
with each other. Mesh is communicating to Service registry and Mesh
knows how to call other service and where to find it. It also knows
which instances are healthy. It automatically collects logs, matrics and
sends it to proper places. Service Mesh approach has become popular
recently. I suggest don&rsquo;t jump start Service Mesh if you are
implementing microservice for the first time because It will be the most
important piece in your infrastructure. If anything goes wrong with
Service Mesh, your entire system will be down. Before implementing
Service Mesh, make sure you assign a dedicated team who understand
Service Mesh framework inside out. The service mesh is a new approach
so, there are not many mature production ready frameworks available.
[Istio] is getting popular and [Linkerd] is another popular framework.</p>
<p>Service Mesh has the following benefit and challenge.</p>
<ol>
<li>No libraries to maintain, automatic observability and security,
easier to manage a large number of services.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s another critical piece of infrastructure to manage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, What is the solution of Routing in microservice?</p>
<p>It depends upon the type of project size and complexity but If it&rsquo;s your
first microservice project. I suggest starting with Consul by
HarshiCorp.</p>
<h2 id="services-management">Services Management</h2>
<p>Management of services is challenging if you do not have the right tools
and knowledge. I suggest you should start with Docker, run Docker in
production, debug Docker in production, fix docker issues in production.
Once you are comfortable with Docker in production then implement
service registry i.e. Consul. Make yourself comfortable with a service
registry in production. Don&rsquo;t jump start to container orchestration
engine. Start slow, start with a small team. Don&rsquo;t introduce container
orchestration engine until you feel that you have too many services and
too many servers which you are not able to manage manually.</p>
<p>The popular container orchestration frameworks</p>
<ol>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>Docker Swarm</li>
<li>Nomad</li>
<li>Mesos + Marathon</li>
<li>Cloud Providers Features &mdash; Amazon ECS/ Fargate</li>
</ol>
<p>Kubernetes is the most popular amongst the open source community. I also
recommend going for it unless you are working on .Net and deploy the
project on Azure. [Microsoft Azure Fabric] Service Mesh is readymade
service provided by Azure. Kuberneters make your life simple. Kubernetes
is developed by Google&rsquo;s Engineers. Kubernetes is an open source project
and part of CNFC. In Kubernetes, everything is managed using Pods. Pods
are essentially like mini VM where you can run one or more containers
(Docker). You can run service mesh as a sidecar on the same pod with
Istio. Kubernetes has many features out of the box. There are many tools
like Helm, Minikube, Kopts etc. which will make development and
deployment much easier.</p>
<h2 id="observability">Observability</h2>
<p>Once you are using Kubernetes for microservice architecture, your next
challenges will be: How to see things? What&rsquo;s going inside the cluster?
Where to get accurate logs? How to scale services independently? How to
manage ingress? How to configure a load balancer for services? How to
protect sensitive information? And many more&hellip;</p>
<p>In a Monolithic system, you can have SSH into the instance and check
what&rsquo;s going on in the system but in the word of Kubernetes and
microservices, software or program runs behind many layers
(virtualization, docker engine, etc). Many dockers run on a single VM.
In this case, developers may ask Why my service is slow? Why others'
services are fast? Why my service is slow sometimes but not always? Why
my request for other service gets time-out sometimes? Any many more&hellip;
to answer all the questions you start collecting metrics and logs.
Metrics might not help as you expected even with 20 to 30 services
because it will generate a lot of data so you will be confused with
where to look and what to look in matrices. Now the question is which
matrix do you care about? Maybe start with memory and CPU? You may be
looking for container&rsquo;s CPU and Memory and Host VM&rsquo;s CPU and Memory,
Disk Usage and Network usage. Even if you have 20&ndash;30 services with 2&ndash;3
instances of each makes 100 containers to watch. It will generate huge
data. It&rsquo;s just too much information that you can&rsquo;t make sense of. So,
Make sure to collect matrices and logs which will help you to answer
questions when something critical happens. Here are a few tools which
will help you increase observability</p>
<p><strong>Logs</strong>: ELK, Spunk, Sumo Logic, Cloud provider&rsquo;s log collectors.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>: Prometheus, InfluxDB, Datadog, Wavefront, New Relic.</p>
<p><strong>Tracing</strong>: Zipking, Opentracing, Jaeger, Stackdrive.</p>
<p>Distributed tracing is the most essential part of observability. It will
act as Systrace of your services. In which you can identify data flows
between service with time. You can identify the various issue. You can
identify which service is faster and which one is slower. Think about
which logs and matrices you care about and log only those.</p>
<h2 id="developers-life">Developer&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>You want your developer to be happy. You need to understand how they
work in monolithic architecture and what will change when you move to
microservice. Everyone always wants development, test and production
environment to be as identical as possible. A developer wants to run a
service on his/her laptop. In a microservice architecture, Developer A&rsquo;s
service depends upon Service B which is being developed by a different
team. It may happen that the developer&rsquo;s service is dependent on 5&ndash;6
different services. It would be challenging to fulfil all dependency on
a laptop. If you are running Docker in production, developers may run
Docker in the laptop to test but if you are running Kubernetes in
production then does that mean developers will need to run Kubernetes in
a laptop? The answer depends on your setup. It will work if you have a
limited number of services but assume that you have more then 30
services. It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to install everything on a developer&rsquo;s
laptop. Now, you need to think about how you can provide all the
dependencies locally. The bad news is that there isn&rsquo;t any proper
solution available yet. Nobody has solved this problem perfectly. There
are a few approaches that you can take and the most popular is a shared
cloud environment. You can have a development environment where all
services are deployed and you can run your service against it from your
laptop. It will work with some shortcomings. As many teams are
developing different services and deploy on the same shared environment.
It may happen that some other teams deploy the latest version of their
service and you are not aware of changes deployed by another team, your
service may stop because of that. Another approach is Mock services.
It&rsquo;s not full service, it will not have a real data set. You may lose
corner cases and developing and testing Mock services will take
additional time. The last approach can be to map dependencies to load
them automatically. You need some program which identifies dependencies
of your service and procure it for you before you execute your service.
This is very hard to do. There isn&rsquo;t any ready to use tool available now
for dependency management. I think a shared cloud environment is easy
and useful approach as of now.</p>
<p>Next challenge would be tools and integration. You need development
tools which are integrated with IDE for debugging and also integration
with orchestration framework. You also need to build CI / CD pipeline
which supports containers.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about new tools and technologies yet. Use the tools you
know. There are many new technologies like Docker, Istio, Kuberneters,
Serverless, GraphQL, TICK Stack, MEAN Stack, Event Sourcing, CQRS
pattern, Micro Frontends etc. but the most important things that
companies really care about are success and performance. Remember that
you are trying to solve a business problem. Business only cares about
solving a business problem. They do not care about which tools &amp;
technologies you employ. If you think that you can solve a business
problem with old stable technologies then go for it. It&rsquo;s not necessary
to use cutting edge technologies just for the sake of novelty or hype.
Make project success, get the users in the market then think about
microservices and other latest technologies, that too only if it
improves upon the existing solution significantly. Moving from
monolithic to a microservice architecture isn&rsquo;t just a change in coding.
It&rsquo;s a much bigger change in organisational structure, communication and
coding culture.</p>
