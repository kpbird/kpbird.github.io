      <h2 id="my-personal-technology-radar-for2018">My Personal Technology Radar for 2018</h2>
<p>Technology radar is published by ThoughtWorks. It publishes insights
into the technology and trends which may shape the future. It also
maintains position of existing tools and technologies. I am writing my
personal technology radar in this article. I will explain tools,
technologies and frameworks which I will keep an eye on for this year.</p>
<p>Software industry is moving too fast these days. The main problem for
every one is to predict which technology will grow and become mainstream
and which one are just buzz words. It&rsquo;s nearly impossible for a person
to keep track of all latest technologies, I am not exception in that so
I have decided to keep an eye on following technologies for the 2018.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning--artificial-intelligence">Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<ul>
<li>[<strong>Scikit Python:</strong>] It&rsquo;s the most popular machine learning library
in Python. Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data
analysis. Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts.
It&rsquo;s built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib. Open source, commercially
usable &mdash; BSD license. Sickit does not support GPU for processing.
Scikit developers belive that GPUs don&rsquo;t play a large role in
machine learning today and much larger gains in speed can often be
achieved by a careful choice of algorithms.</li>
<li>[<strong>Tenserflow:</strong>] It is an open-source software library for
dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math
library, and also used for machine learning applications such as
neural networks. Tenserflow lite and mobile versions are available
which helps to run model in low GPU/CPU devices such as Android, iOS
and Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>[<strong>Apache Spark</strong>]<strong>:</strong> It is known as a fast, easy-to-use and
general engine for big data processing that has built-in modules for
streaming, SQL, Machine Learning (ML) and graph processing.</li>
<li>[<strong>Deeplearning4j:</strong>] Eclipse Deeplearning4j is a deep learning
programming library written for Java and the Java virtual machine
(JVM) and a computing framework with wide support for deep learning
algorithms. Tensorflow, Keras and Deeplearning4j work together.
Deeplearning4j can import models from Tensorflow and other Python
frameworks if they have been created with Keras.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="containers">Containers</h2>
<ul>
<li>[<strong>Docker:</strong>] Docker is a software technology providing
operating-system-level virtualization also known as containers,
promoted by the company Docker, Inc. Docker is not new so why it&rsquo;s
in my list? Actually I am looking for products which are built
around Docker, like Docker compose, docker machine, docker cloud
etc.</li>
<li>[<strong>Kubernetes:</strong>] It is an open-source system for automating
deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.
It&rsquo;s container orchestration tool. Kubernetes is also known like
Docker but again I am interested in ecosystem and projects developed
around Kubernetes, like [kubless], [openfaas], [fission],
[workflow].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="serverless">Serverless</h2>
<ul>
<li>[<strong>openwhisk:</strong>] Apache OpenWhisk (Incubating) is a serverless,
open source cloud platform that executes functions in response to
events at any scale. IBM provides openwhisk as service as pert of
BlueMix. Openwhisk is more mature compare to Fn project but it&rsquo;s
also complex to deploy and maintain. check [architecture of
openwhisk].</li>
<li>[<strong>Fn project:</strong>] It&rsquo;s an event-driven, open source,
Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) compute platform that you can run
anywhere. Written in Go, It&rsquo;s native to docker, and runs every
function in docker container which means you can run any programming
language with Fn project. It&rsquo;s easy to operate and maintain. I
think, Fn project is not production ready yet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h2>
<ul>
<li>[<strong>Ethereum:</strong>] Here, I mean ethereum framework and solidity
language. Using Ethereum framework you can implement blockchain use
cases. Ethereum is community driven and very fast moving
technology.</li>
<li>[<strong>Hyperledger</strong>][]: It&rsquo;s another blockchain framework. Hyperledger
is considered as business or enterprise blockchain. It is modular
and extendable framework. Hyperledger is manage by Linux Foundation
and govern by many companies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iot">IoT</h2>
<ul>
<li>[<strong>Kaaproject</strong>]<strong>:</strong> Kaa is an open-source platform for building
and facilitating applications in the realm of Internet of Things. It
is horizontally scalable, fault tolerant and provides a broad set of
features. Kaa provide [SDKs] for popular languages and It has out of
the box hardware support.</li>
<li>[Red-Node]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mbaas">MBaaS</h2>
<ul>
<li>[<strong>Google Firebase</strong>]<strong>:</strong> Its really next generation MBaaS (Mobile
Backend as a Service). I consider firebase as next generation
because I consider Parse.com (If you remember) I consider it as
first generation. Parse was providing database and authentication
only but when we look at Firebase, it provides many services and
Google Cloud Function to write logic. Firebase best to build PoC.
Google seems very serious for Firebase based on how they are adding
features in to it.</li>
<li>[<strong>CloudBoost:</strong>] If you want to use Firebase but you want
everything in on premise or hosted on your server which you can
control then CloudBoost.io is best for you. Cloudboost provide
almost same functionality as Firebase but entire project is open
source. Cloudboost also provides hosted / cloud solution if you do
not want to host on premise.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mobile-development">Mobile Development</h2>
<ul>
<li>[<strong>Flutter</strong>][]: It is most interesting cross platform app
development tool. It&rsquo;s still in alpha version. I am interested
because they took unique approach to develop cross platform
applications. Flutter does not use native widget or components to
render the UI. Instead they have developped their own components
which looks like native Android and iOS. Flutter just takes screen
from OS and render every pixel on it&rsquo;s own. They know productivity
and performance are key to success. In Flutter they keep these thing
in mind. Following is the introduction sentence of Flutter.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Flutter is a mobile app SDK for building high-performance,
high-fidelity, apps for iOS and Android, from a single codebase.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[<strong>Reactive Native</strong>]<strong>:</strong> It&rsquo;s open source framework from
Facebook. The main difference between Ionic and Reactive Native is
rendering. Ionic uses web view for rendering widget while Reactive
Native uses native widget for rendering.</li>
<li>[<strong>Ionic</strong>]<strong>:</strong> Ionic is an HTML5 mobile app development framework
targeted at building hybrid mobile apps. Hybrid apps are essentially
small websites running in a browser shell in an app that have access
to the native platform layer. Frontend developers can develop web
and mobile both if you use NodeJs as backend. If your application is
data driven and you do not need fancy animation then Ionic is
perfect choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h2>
<ul>
<li>[<strong>Java 9</strong>]<strong>:</strong> I think this is biggest change ever seen by Java
community. Java 9 introduces modularity, REPL, compiler improvements
and much more. Before Java 9, Java&rsquo;s popularity was dropping, young
developers and startups were choosing other languages but after Java
9 and 6 months release plan Java&rsquo;s community will be vibrant again.
I think Java will again attract developers and startups. Even after
all ups and downs of Sun Microsoft System and Oracle, Java has
managed to maintain 1st rank in [TIOBE Index.]</li>
<li>[<strong>Kotlin</strong>]<strong>:</strong> Statically typed programming language for modern
multi-platform applications. Kotlin was not very popular language
until last may, when Google announce Kotlin as first class
programming language support for Android development. Kotlin is
developed by Jet Brain - a company which is famous for IDE
development. In [TIOBE Index][TIOBE Index.] Kotlin ranked 39. The
only reason that Kotlin is in my personal technology radar is
&ldquo;Android&rdquo; development.</li>
<li>[<strong>Go Lang:</strong>] If you are looking for performance, productivity and
simplicity then Go Lang is perfect place. I am learning Go Lang
since last year. It&rsquo;s open source statically typed programming
language from Google. It&rsquo;s general purpose language</li>
<li>[<strong>Dart</strong>]<strong>:</strong> I do not have experience with Dart language but I
am learning it because of Flutter.io. According to wikipedia
following is the purpose of Dart language.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dart</strong> is a [general-purpose programming language] originally
developed by [Google] and later approved as a standard by [Ecma]
(ECMA-408). It is used to build web, server and mobile applications,
and for [Internet of Things]<a href="IoT"></a> devices. It is [open-source
software] under a [permissive free software license]</p>
</blockquote>

<li>[<strong>Python</strong>]<strong>:</strong> Python is a general-purpose programming language
that can pretty much do anything you need it to: data munging, data
engineering, data wrangling, website scraping, web app building and
more. It&rsquo;s simpler to master than R. Also, python has many great
libraries for data science or statistics which are specially used in
machine learning like scikit-learn, numpy, matloplib for data
visualization, pandas, scipy etc.</li>

<p>Apart from above list I am also interested in Quantum computing. IBM,
Microsoft and other big companies are working very hard to make it
available to developer and hardware manufacturers. Quantum computing
will change entire paradigm of computer processing. Few helpful links
[link1], [link2], [link3] and [link4]. Google is working on new
Operating System called [fuchsia]. [Computer Brain Interface] will be
another big thing that may change how we interact with the computer.
[Emotiv] is working on CBI. We don&rsquo;t know what future hold for us.</p>
