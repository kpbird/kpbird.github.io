      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/golang.jpeg" alt="Go Language For Java Developer" title="Go Language For Java Developer" class="img-responsive"></p>

<p>Go language is normally known as golang. It&#39;s general purpose programming language developed at Google in 2007 by three Google employees namely Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. In November 2008 Google had announced Go Language to public and made it <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go">open source</a>.</p>

<p>Go language compiler is available for the Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9, and Microsoft Windows operating systems and the i386, amd64, ARM and IBM POWER processor architectures.</p>

<p>Beginner Go language developer should visit following links.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/">Go Language</a></li>
<li><a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go">Go Language Source</a></li>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#What_is_the_purpose_of_the_project">Go Language FAQ</a></li>

<li><a href="http://golangweekly.com/">Go Newsletter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://yager.io/programming/go.html">Why Go is not good?</a> </li>
</ol>

<p>As you are reading this article, It means I can assume that you know about Go Language and it&#39;s advantage and shortcoming. As the title suggest it&#39;s for Java developers, so I can also assume that you have knowledge of core Java. </p>

<p><strong>Install Go Language</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Download installer binary / package / installer as per your OS </li>
<li><a href="https://golang.org/dl/">https://golang.org/dl/</a></li>
<li>Current version is go 1.4.2</li>
<li>Run package to install Go language</li>
<li>After setup completes, you need to set environment variable to go language</li>
<li><p>In case of OX, Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by    adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or   $HOME/.bash_profile:</p>

<p>export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin</p></li>
<li><p>To verify installation, you can execute following command</p>

<p>$go version
go version go1.4.2 darwin/amd64</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Go Language IDE</strong>
Officially, Go Language don&#39;t have any IDE but there are many open source 3rd party IDEs / Plugins are available. If you are familiar with IntelliJ or Eclipse then you can install plug-in for Go Language. For more details, please visit following link
<a href="http://geekmonkey.org/articles/20-comparison-of-ides-for-google-go">http://geekmonkey.org/articles/20-comparison-of-ides-for-google-go</a>    </p>

<p>Now, you have enough details to jump start coding. In next article I will cover fundamentals and syntax of Go Language.</p>

<p>SyncAdapter is standard and preferred way to sync application data with server, cloud or MBaaS backend. SyncAdapter is the most efficient way to make your application update to date. It will help you to present fresh data when user open application. You can increase user experience by not making wait to user till you call web service and fetch the data. Almost all popular android application use SyncAdapter, you check from Setting -&gt; Account, you will find accounts i.e. google, twitter, facebook, etc.. It means these application use SyncAdapter.</p>

<p><strong>Why SyncAdapter?</strong></p>

<p>As Lazy developer you might think why should I put an effort to write SyncAdapter. SyncAdapter is complex!!, I can directly make network call when required, and more... </p>

<p>Let’s compare custom sync with SyncAdapter</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>And many more</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>I hope above table is sufficient to convince to create sync adapter demo. </p>

<p><strong>Concepts</strong></p>

<p>Concepts are very important to read before jump to the demo. Many developer don’t read API document or understand concept and directly start sample and try to learn from it but I suggest to read concept first before open your IDE and read the code. SyncAdapter has mainly two section 1. Account management 2. Sync Adapter. If your app requires user credentials or server login, you can optionally integrate account management and authentication into your data transfer.</p>

<p>SyncAdapter has following sections.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sqlite Database:</strong> I guess you all are master of Sqlite database, SyncAdapter will store data in Sqlite using Content Provider. You may choose other options as well. </li>
<li><strong>Content Provider:</strong>  Act as bridge between your database and SyncAdapter. To expose your data in Rest like URL pattern.</li>
<li><strong>AbstractAccountAuthenticator:</strong> As developer we need to extend this class and override methods, It is primarily used to manage authentication and account management. To use SyncAdapter you must have custom account. This class is responsible to create account, maintain auth token and various things related to authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Authenticator Service:</strong> This is normal Service, which we are using daily. The only difference is that this service create object of AbstractAccountAuthenticator class and bind.</li>
<li><strong>AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter:</strong> As developer we need to extend this class and override methods. . This is the main piece of SyncAdapter puzzle. It has method onPerformSync, in which we need to write our code.<br></li>
<li><strong>Sync Service:</strong> This is normal Service. It use to create object of AbstractThreadedSyncAdapter class and bind.</li>
<li><strong>Authenticator.xml:</strong> You need to create this file under res/xml/ folder. This file is required to bind your authenticator component into the sync adapter and account frameworks, you need to provide these framework with metadata that describes the component. You can choose your own file name. </li>
<li><strong>SyncAdapter.xml:</strong> You need to create this file under res/xml/ folder.  The metadata specifies the account type you&#39;ve created for your sync adapter, declares a content provider authority associated with your app.</li>
<li><strong>AndroidManifast.xml:</strong> You must register Sync Service, Authenticator service and few other things in AndroidManifast file in order to work SyncAdapter, This is the final piece of puzzle.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Diagram</strong></p>

<p>Following diagram depicted relationship between all different components of Sync Adapter. Account Manager and Sync Manager are provided by Android OS, except these two thing everything else you need to implement.
<a href="/assets/images/posts/SyncAdapter_large.png" target="_blank">
<img src="/assets/images/posts/SyncAdapter_small.png" alt="Android SyncAdapter" title="Android SyncAdapter" class="img-responsive"></a></p>

<p><strong>Coding - Let’s jump to the code</strong></p>

<p>I am taking simple example ToDo list sync with Parse.com (Parse is BaaS service, If you want to know more about BaaS or MBaaS Service, please refer this article). </p>

<p>You will find many sync adapter example with “AccountAuthenticatorActivity”, In this situation you need to develop your login screen by extending “AccountAuthenticatorActivity”, but this might not be case in every project. In few situation you might want to use sync adapter without login / registration. In this demo I will explain how to create ToDo list with Parse.com as backend and without login / registration. </p>

<p>When user start application, It will fetch primary Gmail account and create Parse User through coding. For simplicity I will sync ToDo list only single direction, from Parse.com to local, you can have bi-directional sync based on need. </p>

<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Open Android Studio</li>
<li>Create Project Name “SimpleSyncAdapter”

<ul>
<li>Minimum SDK: 4.0</li>
<li>Package Name: com.kpbird.simplesyncadapter</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create Blank Activity</li>
<li>Download Parse Android SDK (<a href="https://parse.com/docs/downloads">https://parse.com/docs/downloads</a>), Copy Parse.jar in lib folder and click “Sync Project with Gradle File” button in toolbar.</li>
<li>We will create following files</li>
</ol>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Sr</th>
    <th>File</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>SimpleAuthenticator.java</td>
    <td>This class will hold authentication related information</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>SimpleAuthenticatorService.java</td>
    <td>This class will provide object of SimpleAuthenticator class </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>SimpleContentProvider.java</td>
    <td>This class is responsible for database operation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>SimpleInit.java</td>
    <td>This will initialize Parse library and fetch default Gmail account</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>SimpleSyncAdapter.java</td>
    <td>This class ir responsible for Sync, Android OS will call onPerformSync method, we need to write our sync code in onPerformSync method.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>SimpleSyncAdapterService.java</td>
    <td>This will provide object of SimpleSyncAdapter to the sync framework</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>SyncConstants.java</td>
    <td>This will hold all required constants</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>SyncUtil.java</td>
    <td>This will have common methods </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>authenticator.xml</td>
    <td>Meta information of Authentication</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>sync_adapter.xml</td>
    <td>Meta information of Sync Adapter</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>_&quot;A smartwatch (or smart watch) is a computerized wristwatch with functionality that is enhanced beyond timekeeping, and is often comparable to a personal digital assistant (PDA) device&quot; - _Wikipedia</p>

<p>Avi Greengart, a consumer device analyst, predicted that 2013 may be &quot;the year of Smart watch&quot;. This prediction turned out to be true as majority of smart phone manufacturer are focusing on smart watch and wearable. Many of them have already released smart watch and others have near future release plans. It is forecasted that 350 million smart watches will ship by 2020<a href="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_500_500/p/4/005/09f/13c/35409df.png">1</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_500_500/p/4/005/09f/13c/35409df.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Smart watch shipments 2013-2020 (in millions)</p>

<p>There are numerous day-to-day use cases that can be made simple yet secure with usage of smart watch. Let&#39;s have quick look, how smart watch can make your life easy.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Smart Watch as ID card:</strong> Do you forget to carry ID card every morning? NFC based smart watch can work as your ID card. Enterprise can do away with hassle of issuing separate ID card to employees having smart watch.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Watch as Wallet:</strong> Do you feel your wallet is bulky with credit cards and other useless stuff? Smart watch can replace your need to carry credit cards. Smart Watch and &quot;Card on File&quot; concept can replace need of carrying plastic card in your wallet.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Watch as Health monitor:</strong> Are you a health geek? Or having health issue which requires continuous monitoring? A smart watch with sensors like Heart Rate, Body Temperature, Accelerometer, etc., will collect your health data and upload to cloud for 24x7 care.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Watch as Remote control</strong>: Are you confused with different remotes for different systems like home garage door, television, Set Top Box etc.? Smart Watch with Bluetooth can work as remote for your garage, television etc.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Watch as Security Token:</strong> Do you need to carry RSA Token to access highly secure software or physical location (like Server Room). Smart watch can work as RSA token, it can generate software RSA key. Or it can add 3rd factor of authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Watch as SOS Device:</strong> Smart watch knows when you could be in danger and sends for help. Smart watch contains a gyroscope and an accelerometer, that detect physical activity or aggressive movements, and mobile app send SMS and email to configured emergency contacts with your current location.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Watch as Notification/Reminder Device:</strong> This is prime feature of smart watch as of now. It will display different notification from smart phone and allow quick action. With smart watch you will never miss important things like breaking news, flight alerts, meeting calls, reminders, weather alerts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Smart Watch will change our life in many ways. It can become your identity for office access, wallet for payment, car door keys and much more…Vision is smart watch will replace your need of carrying disparate accessibility tokens including a smart phone.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/3504283.jpg" alt="Wearable technology to monitor Parkinson’s disease" class="img-responsive"></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Parkinson&#39;s disease is a degenerative disorder of central nervous system. It&#39;s more common in older people after the age of 60. It is sometime call idiopathic because it has not external identifiable cause. The early symptoms of disease are shaking, difficulty with walking, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movements), postural instability, freezing and loss a sense of smell. In later stage when disease increase, patient may have behavior and thinking issues. According to the National Parkinson’s Foundation survey in 2010 [1], nearly 1 million people in the U.S. are living with Parkinson’s disease, with between 50,000 and 60,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Medication costs for an individual person with Parkinson&#39;s disease average $2,500 a year [2].</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>There is not biological markers to diagnose Parkinson’s disease. Researchers are working hard to identify the cause of disease.</p>

<p>The physicians are use following techniques for diagnosis.</p>

<ol>
<li>The doctor tries to observe if patient’s expression is animated.</li>
<li>Patient’s arms are observed for tremor, which is present either when they are at rest, or extended.</li>
<li>Is there stiffness in patient’s limbs or neck?</li>
<li>Can patient rise from a chair easily?</li>
<li>Do patient walk normally or with short steps, and symmetrically swing their arms? The doctor will pull patient backwards.</li>
<li>How quickly can patient regain his/her balance?</li>
</ol>

<p>Above techniques are traditional and subjective, the result may vary as per doctor&#39;s observation. These techniques have not changed since Dr. James Parkinson suggested before 200 years (1817). There is no cure for Parkinson’s, but the drug levadopa and other medications can control symptoms for years together. In addition to above techniques physician suggest a patient to undergo PET Scan, CT Scan and MRI to check other effects on body. Accurate and objective diagnosis is primary challenge for physician.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>The primary symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s disease is Moto symptoms - Shaking or tremor and walking difficulty. Latest technical innovation in sensors and wearable has potential to transform current practice of observing &amp; capturing effect of Moto symptoms on patients. With the wearable device monitoring, symptoms can be measured objectively. For instance, a patient might inform the doctor that he felt tremor for several minutes, whereas actual duration would have been few seconds. With these wearable device doctors can get precise measurements about the &quot;frequency and severity&quot; of symptoms.</p>

<p>There are multifold benefits of using wearable to monitor patients.</p>

<ol>
<li>Automatically capture data without any effort made by patient.
Real-time analysis.</li>
<li>Data will be store in cloud to provide accessibility anywhere, anytime.</li>
<li>Doctors can diagnosis multiple patient at a same time with cloud based system.</li>
<li>Patient need not visit doctor for routine observation.</li>
<li>Data will be helpful for research.</li>
<li>Data will be used to monitor effect of new drug.</li>
<li>Data will be used for progression of disease and behavior pattern.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Wearable has potential to revolutionize diagnosis technique for Parkinson&#39;s disease. Using wearable technology, researchers can actually monitor and measurable Moto symptoms. It will help to find new drugs, can save thousands of dollars and most importantly researchers will find cause and treatment of Parkinson&#39;s disease to save patient&#39;s life.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/007ac2e.png" alt="Monolithic vs MicroService Architecture" class="img-responsive"></p>

<p><em>Monolithic architecture is something that build from single piece of material, historically from rock. Monolith term normally use for object made from single large piece of material.”</em> - <strong>Non-Technical Definition</strong></p>

<p><em>“Monolithic application has single code base with multiple modules. Modules are divided as either for business features or technical features. It has single build system which build entire application and/or dependency. It also has single executable or deployable binary”</em> – <strong>Technical Definition</strong></p>

<p>Industry is using this approach since long to develop enterprise application. Many companies have invested years to build enterprise application with monolithic approach. Sometime it also called multi-tier architecture because monolithic applications are divided in three or more layers or tire i.e. presentation, business, database, application, etc. It was a time of browser evaluation. Enterprise was focused on desktop/laptop devices with Web Browser as client, which doesn&#39;t require to expose data with API, mainly because browsers can understand only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although, Enterprise was using Enterprise Data Bus(EDB), Electronic Data Interchange(EDI) , Enterprise Data Exchange (EDX) and many more (<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/standards">https://www.oasis-open.org/standards</a>) data exchange format to interact with each other in back-end. Monolithic architecture need of enterprises&#39; at that time.</p>

<p>Suddenly, entire paradigm shift from browser / desktop to mobile / smart devices. Enterprise need to serve data to different devices and form factors (smart phone, tablet, handheld, etc). Smart phone become always available, always on and personal device for everyone, which demand information anytime, anywhere, on fingertip. Mobile application is nearly useless without internet connectivity and backend services. Now is a time for mobile first, every enterprises are looking forward to develop mobile application before web. To developer mobile application enterprise need to expose data using API (REST or SOAP) because legacy data exchange format was not compatible with mobile application. With increasing demand of mobile application force to change back-end architecture. This is prime force behind migrating monolithic architecture to microservice architecture.</p>

<p>Microservice architecture is an approach of building large enterprise application with multiple small unit called service, each service develop, deploy and test individually. Each service intercommunicate with a common communication protocol like REST web service with JSON. Each service run individually either in single machine or different machine but they execute its own separate process. Each service may have own database or storage system or they can share common database or storage system. Microservice is all about distribute or break application in small chunks.</p>

<p>Microservice is more than code and structure. It’s way of working. Its culture in a way, every developer or team own some part of large application. Microservice is not ultimate solution for every application but it’s surely solution for large enterprise application. Microservice has some shortfalls like increase lot of operations overhead, DevOps skills required, complex to manage because of distributed system, bug tracking become challenging.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulties with monolithic application, when it grow</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Large monolithic code base makes complicated to understand, especially for new developer</li>
<li>Scaling become challenging</li>
<li>Continuously integration / deployment become complex and time consuming. You may require dedicated team for build and deploy</li>
<li>Overloaded IDE, Large code base makes IDE slow, build time increase.</li>
<li>Extremely difficult to change technology or language or framework because everything is tightly coupled and depend up on each other.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Privilege with Microservice architecture, when it grow</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Each microservice is small and focused on a specific feature / business requirement.</li>
<li>Microservice can be developed independently by small team of developers (normally 2 to 5 developers).</li>
<li>Microservice is loosely coupled, means services are independent, in terms of development and deployment both.</li>
<li>Microservice can be developed using different programming language (Personally I don&#39;t suggest to do it).</li>
<li>Microservice allows easy and flexible way to integrate automatic deployment with Continuous Integration tools (for e.g: Jenkins, Hudson, bamboo etc..).
The productivity of a new team member will be quick enough.</li>
<li>Microservice allows you to take advantage of emerging and latest technologies (framework, programming language, programming practice, etc.).</li>
<li>Microservice is easy to scale based on demand.
In a nutshell, monolithic vs microservice architecture is like elephant vs ant approach. What you wants to build a giant system like elephant or army of ant, small, fast and effective.</li>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Step 3: Declare callback method</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">    @Override
    public void OnSuccessFacebookLogin(Bundle profile) {
        Log.i(TAG,profile.getString(FacebookLoginUtils.USERID));
        Log.i(TAG,profile.getString(FacebookLoginUtils.EMAIL));
        Log.i(TAG,profile.getString(FacebookLoginUtils.NAME));
        Log.i(TAG,profile.getString(FacebookLoginUtils.FIRST_NAME));
        Log.i(TAG,profile.getString(FacebookLoginUtils.LAST_NAME));

    }
</code></pre></div>
<p>Step 4: Declare object of FacebookLoginUtils.java</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">    private FacebookLoginUtils fLogin;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Step 5: Initialize object in onCreate method</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">        fLogin = new FacebookLoginUtils(this, R.id.activity_login_fb);
        fLogin.setLoginStatus(this);
        fLogin.setEnable(true);
</code></pre></div>
<p>Step 6: Declare few supporting methods&nbsp;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        fLogin.onResume();
    };

    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        fLogin.onPause();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        fLogin.onDestroy();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int responseCode,Intent intent) {
        fLogin.onActivityResult(requestCode, responseCode, intent);
    }
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>

<p>Q: What is the problem of above approach ?</p>

<p>A: You activity has a lot of scattered code for Facebook login, It will be more complex and unmanageable when you will have another social network login like Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p>Q: How I will receive a response for login success?</p>

<p>A: You need to implement interface &quot;FacebookLoginStatus&quot;, on successful login you will receive callback &quot;OnSuccessFacebookLogin&quot;</p>

<p>Q: What will be received on login success ?</p>

<p>A: You will have Name, Email , First Name, Last Name, User Id.</p>

<p>Q: Do I need to handle login failure / error ?</p>

<p>A: No, FacebookLoginUtils.java will handle login failure, error and display appropriate message on screen. &nbsp;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/22783b7.jpg" alt="10 Tips for fledgling developers" class="img-responsive"></p>

<p><strong>1. Continues Study</strong></p>

<p>Never think that you have acquired all or most of the knowledge existing in the world. Almost everybody in India at age of 24 starts thinking that he has acquired all the wisdom and knowledge that he needs. This should be strictly avoided. Continue study after education. Study should be habituated exactly in the same way as you are brushing teeth and taking bath every morning. A regular study, everyday, is extremely essential. Study not only computer science but also other subject in which you are interested. It does not matter whether you study for 10 minutes or 1 hour, but consistency is a must. You should always study basics and fundamentals. There is no point in going for advance topics, you can always go back and re-read or re-iterate over the fundamental concepts. There are plenty of things in computer science that you can study (like operating system, compiler, languages, networking, databases, algorithms, architecture, etc..)</p>

<p>For computer science I suggest to read following books</p>

<ul>
<li>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Albenson and Sussman.</li>
<li>Introduction to Computer Architecture by Hennessy and Patterson.</li>
<li>Fundamentals of Programming by Donald Knuth.</li>
<li>Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Learn Professional Ethics</strong></p>

<p>As computer science professional, you are morally obliged to do a good job. What this means is that you are supposed to do your job not for your manager or company or client but for yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Doing duties of your life” - Bhagwatgeeta</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The direct implication of this is: never ever write a bad code. You don’t need to be the fastest and run after deadline rather you need to write quality code. Never write junk code. Rewrite it till you are satisfied with the quality. Remember that you are writing code not only for compiler but for humans also, your code must be easy to unstandable by other developers. Writing good code is an art and aesthetic beauty build in it. You should feel uneasy at writing bad code. To judge quality of code, you should compare with good and popular open source library written in the same language.</p>

<p><strong>3. Read a lot of code</strong></p>

<p>Read a lot of quality code written by excellent programmers. Not just good programmers, like the best guy in your circle, but those who have delivered on international scale. It’s very easy because you have access to the huge amount of open source codebase today. You can either refer github or code.google.com, this is easy and helpful for you. When I was learning Java, I read code from the Tomcat project and JDK source code. I&#39;ve read lots of good code ever since and I still refer to it. Read the code. Look at the comments, see what the authors are doing, and how they went about it.</p>

<p><strong>4. Learn your tools thoroughly</strong></p>

<p>I think the loss of programming time is not in debugging or rewriting code, but in the innumerable seconds lost here and there by developers who don&#39;t really know their tools. I am referring to: the IDE, the language, the build system, the SVN, etc.. the IDE and the language are by far the most important. Remember maximum shortcut keys of IDE, memorize most useful methods and classes of language. for the language I suggest to read API documents. Keep the API documentation handy while developing. Sometimes, it may happen that functionality which you are trying to develop is readily available in API or there should be some class which will help in saving your efforts to a great extent.</p>

<p><strong>5. Academic is not like the real world</strong></p>

<p>Your percentage largely doesn’t matter. What matters is your practical experience you earn by solving real world problems. To the extent that it does matter to meet minimum criteria for interview process. It only determines whether your resume gets selected for job interviews. Academic is just startup, subject that you learn in college is just an introduction for language or concept, there are lot in depth things and concept you need to study for real world development. There are only three things which will help you to crack the interview - Knowledge, Knowledge and Knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>6. Don&#39;t focus on job security</strong></p>

<p>It’s normal human behavior, everyone wants stable and secure job in large company but The thing is though, those large companies usually aren&#39;t a very satisfying place to work. Things take a long time to get done, and the bureaucracy alone is enough to drain you mentally after a few years. our skills are outdated faster if you don’t upgrade your self with new tools and technologies. Usually large companies don’t allow that freedom to you. At that point, you&#39;re pretty much stuck at a crappy job. If you want long-term job security, the best way to achieve that is to just make sure that you&#39;re very good at what you do, and that you love doing it. If you have knowledge and experience, you will find job in market even if market is not booming. Make sure that you enjoy your job, If not then don’t be afraid to leave.</p>

<p><strong>7. Build your portfolio</strong></p>

<p>Your portfolio means your public presence, create account in stackoverflow and help other people, create your blog and share your knowledge and experience. create account in github and make your side project / library open source. Attend meet-up, conference or technical event in your city or nearby. Take part in technical discussion. Read technical blogs written by others and write your thought in comment section.</p>

<p><strong>8. Working with Humans</strong></p>

<p>The unexpected part is that it’s the human aspect (mostly not the technical ones) that trump everything – unless it’s a one person project for yourself :-). You need to communicate with your team members and work within their personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. And, human craziness can destroy even the most technically brilliant project. Making non-technical people understand technical insights has been a bit difficult in my experience.</p>

<p><strong>9. Figure out your Goals</strong></p>

<p>Always aspire doing bigger things in life. Viewing promotion path as your career goal is completely wrong concept. If you are really interested to study and learn new things. Never aspire of being manager but aspire of being excellent programmer / developer. Normally in Indian software company you will be promoted as some kind of managerial role after 6 or 7 years of experience. You might feel that you want to do certain things which you cannot do till you become a manager. When you become a manager, you will soon realize that now you just cannot do anything that you thought of. The three biggest mistakes that people usually make are aiming for money, aiming for promotion and aiming for fame. The moment you get some of these, you aspire for some more and then there is no end. I do not mean that you should not earn money, but you should understand how much money would satisfy your needs. Bill Clinton might be the richest person in the world; he is certainly not the happiest.</p>

<p><strong>10. Follow your culture</strong></p>

<p>I have seen the tradition that whatever junk is created in US, it rapidly spreads up in India and specially in our industry. This cultural change creates a very strong impact on everybody’s life. To act and behave like pseudo US/UK/etc. citizen is stupid thing, but believe me, there is nothing great in that. This all just makes you run away from your culture. And there is no wisdom in running away from your culture. Indian culture, which has great Vedas and stories like Mahabharata and Bhagwatgeeta is really great. You should understand that fundamental things in Indian culture teach you a lot and you should never forget them.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that it’s your life...don&#39;t waste it on stupid things...develop your tests, and start the fight.</strong></p>
