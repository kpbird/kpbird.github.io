NoSQL is buzz word now-a-days among the developers and software professionals.

**1. What is NoSQL?**

NoSQL database, also called Not Only SQL, is an approach to data management and database design that's useful for very large sets of distributed data.

**2. Where to use NoSQL ?**

Use NOSQL, When project has unstructured big data that require real-time or offline analysis or web/mobile application. i.e. Social Network app, Analytics app.

**3. Advantages and Disadvantages of NoSQL DB.**

Advantages of NoSQL

* Elastic scaling
* Big Data
* Ecomomics
* Flexible data models

Disadvantages of NoSQL

* Maturity
* Support
* Analytics and business intelligence
* Administration
* Expertise

**4. Category of NoSQL**

* Column
* Document
* Key-value
* Graph


**5. How many NoSQL database are available in market?**

More then 110 different (Open Source and Proprietary) NoSQL database available in market

**6. If all NoSQL database fall under above category then what is purpose of having lots of NoSQL databases ?**

Every NOSQL database has some special feature & functionality which makes it different, Base on the project requirement one can choose NOSQL database.

**7. Can I use multiple NoSQL in my project / application ?**

Yes

**8. List of popular NoSQL database with usage.**

**Radis:** For rapidly changing data (should fit mostly in memory). i.e. to store real-time stock prices, analytics, leaderboards and communication. And replacement of memcached.

**MongoDB:** When you need dynamic queries, defined indexes, map/reduce and good performance on a big DB. i.e. for most things that you would do with MySQL but having predefined columns really holds you back.

**Cassandra:** When you need to store data so huge that it doesn't fit on server, but still want a friendly familiar interface to it. When you don't need real-time analysis or other operation. i.e. Web analytics, Transaction logging, Data collection from huge sensor arrays.

**Riak:** If you need very good single-site scalability, availability and fault-tolerance, but you're ready to pay for multi-site replication. i.e. Point-of-sales data collection. Factory control systems. Places where even seconds of downtime hurt. Could be used as a well-update-able web server.

**CouchDB:** For accumulating, occasionally changing data, on which pre-defined queries are to be run. Places where versioning is important. i.e. CRM, CMS systems. Master-master replication is an especially interesting feature, allowing easy multi-site deployments.

**HBase:** Hadoop is probably still the best way to run Map/Reduce jobs on huge datasets. Best if you use the Hadoop/HDFS stack already. ie. Search engines. Analysing log data. Any place where scanning huge, two-dimensional join-less tables are a requirement.

**Accumulo:** If you need to restict access on the cell level. i.e. Same as HBase, since it's basically a replacement: Search engines.

**Hypertable:** If you need a better HBase. i.e/ Same as HBase, since it's basically a replacement: Search engines.

**Neo4j:** For graph-style, rich or complex, interconnected data. Neo4j is quite different from the others in this sense. i.e. For searching routes in social relations, public transport links, road maps, or network topologies.

**ElasticSearch:** When you have objects with (flexible) fields, and you need "advanced search" functionality. i.e. A dating service that handles age difference, geographic location, tastes and dislikes, etc. Or a leaderboard system that depends on many variables. you can replace your Solr with ElasticSearch.

**Couchbase:** Any application where low-latency data access, high concurrency support and high availability is a requirement. i.e. Low-latency use-cases like ad targeting or highly-concurrent web apps like online gaming (e.g. Zynga).

**9. Can I have video tutorial to learn more about NoSQL?**

Sure, Watch following video..
