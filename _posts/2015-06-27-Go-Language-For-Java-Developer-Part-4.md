There are few obvious keywords like break, case, if, for, etc but few keywords are new in Go Language.

1. fund: To declare function
2. interface: To declare interface (It's different than Java's interface)
3. defer: something like finalise method in Java
4. go: To create thread
5. chan: To do synchronised between threads
6. var: To declare variable
7. range: It's like iterator in Java
