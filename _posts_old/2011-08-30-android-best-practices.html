<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">1. Be resolution independent. Check out “layoutopt” and “hierarchyviewer” that come with Android SDK under “tools”. They help analyzing and optimizing layouts.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">2. Respect and use an application lifecycle.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">3. In order to avoid friendly “Force Close” popups from your applications, use Android’s “AsyncTask” which will allow to execute a certain activity in background.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">4. Only use a WakeLock when you need one with as minimum level as possible: PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK, FULL_WAKE_LOCK. Here is more about PowerManager.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">5. Always check whether “network connection” is enabled on a device, before attempting to transfer data.</span><br /><a name='more'></a><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">6. Avoid creating objects unless you really need to, try reusing Android’s API instead. Creating an object in a “desktop” world is relatively cheap, however in such a resource constraint environment as a mobile phone, it will drastically impact the performance.. not in a good way.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">7. Externalize resources: localization / optimized layouts / strings / array of strings / etc.. Android compiles them into a list of internal resources by assigning an integer ID to each of them, hence making it “cheaper” at runtime, and easier to change =&gt; since they are defined in a single location.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">8. Think about what an absolute minimum amount of updates / syncs you can do, and stick to this minimum. This will greatly improve battery life as well resource usage by the application.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">9. Think of hiring or delegating UI to people who are designers. Beauty is important.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">10. Consider using a “non sticky” services when appropriate.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">11. &nbsp;Respect a “Back” button: make sure it actually brings user back to a previous state rather than to another state of the application’s flow.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">12. Do not use foreground services unless you absolutely need to.And if you do use foreground services, use an ongoing notification ( which, starting from Android 2.0, used automatically, if a service is started as a foreground one, but just to keep something in mind to be used for older OS versions )</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">13. Kill your own services via stopSelf()</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">14. Don’t use undocumented ( not officially supported ) APIs =&gt; Next Android release your app is going to break.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">15. Use Intents and Intent Filters to Leverage Other Apps.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">16. Prefer Alarms and Intent Receivers to Services.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">17.&nbsp;Make use of <strong>onPause()/onResume</strong> to save or close what does not need to be opened the whole time.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">18.&nbsp;Love RelativeLayout:  Most of the tutorials use  LinearLayout, but you will find that RelativeLayout is truly useful.   Many layouts, like the GridLayout aren't used much at all.  Play around  with RelativeLayout.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">19.&nbsp;Use empty layout items:  You will often use empty items  in your layouts just for positioning other layouts.  For example, you  might use an empty TextField, of width=0 and height=0 and  centerInParent='True' just to anchor things relative to the middle of  the screen.  Also, you might have an empty TextField or LinearLayout so  that you can give a layout_weight=1 to it and have it take up more  screen space.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">20.&nbsp;Learn to search your source:  The fastest solution  to many problems is to find where a particular parameter is used in some  other source.  Put a copy or link to the sample applications,  apps-for-android applications, and any other source you have under one  directory tree.  Use "grep -ir funky_parameter sample_code/" or your  favorite searching routine to quickly find some code that uses that  parameter.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">21.&nbsp;Eclipse MAT is a great tool to analyze memory allocations. It will help to find memory leaks in your application.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">22. If your data set gets relatively large (&gt;100KB) don't store it  in text file or XML file - parsing it will be too expensive. Use the  native SQLite implementation instead.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">23. Starting a new thread is expensive. Use one thread that executes  required tasks one by one, or use thread pools. You should use built in  classes like AsyncTask whenever possible.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">24.&nbsp; MediaPlayer VS. SoundPool :&nbsp;There is a HUGE difference between MediaPlayer and SoundPool. These Java classes play media (sounds, songs, videos, etc). What I think is odd is that I never knew that SoundPool existed! Yeah, if you casually broswe to the Audio Video section of the Android Developer site, it only mentions MeidaPlayer! If you are making an application that is going to play more than 7 sounds and you use MediaPlayer, it will force close no matter which version of the SDK you are running. In fact, if you create the MediaPlayer objects in the beginning of your main class, you will get a force close. I try to read the fine print in the debugger, but I can’t make heads or tails of it. Playing sounds, like Sound Board applications, video games, etc, should be coded to play sounds using the SoundPool. Sure, it’s like 10 more lines of code you have to reference (use Google), but it won’t force close.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /></div></div>
