Go language is normally known as golang, It's general purpose programming language developed at Google in 2007 by three Google employees namely Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. In November 2009 Google announced Go Language to public and make it [open source](https://go.googlesource.com/go)

Go language compiler is available for the Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9, and Microsoft Windows operating systems and the i386, amd64, ARM and IBM POWER processor architectures.

As you are reading this article so I assume that you know what is Go Language, you know the advantage and shortcoming of Golang. As the title suggest it's for Java developers so I can also assume that you know core Java. 

**Install Go Language**

1. Download installer binary / package / installer as per your OS 
2. [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
3. Current version is go 1.4.2
4. Run package to install Go language
5. After setup complete you need to set environment variable to go language
6. In case of OX, Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by 	adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or 	$HOME/.bash_profile:

	export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
